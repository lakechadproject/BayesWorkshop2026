# Additional R Practice

*Katherine Muller, December 2025*

This module contains opportunities for additional R practice. While not required for the workshop in January, we hope that these exercises will provide useful structure for continued self-directed learning.

## Exercise 1: Write some sample code.

A good way to build your R coding skills is to create a portfolio of code that you draw from and adapt for different projects. For this module, you will write a set of R scripts that perform useful analysis tasks. 

I. Write down **five** R coding tasks that would be useful for your work. For inspiration, visit the [Posit Recipes page](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes).


II. Write one or more R scripts that perform these tasks. Save your scripts in the Rmodule2 folder. Make sure to save your scripts under descriptive file names that help you remember what the script does. For example, "myscript.R" is not a helpful file name. 

III. We have provided two sample scripts: [sampleModularScript1.R](Rmodule2/sampleModularScript1.R) [sampleModularScript2.R](Rmodule2/sampleModularScript2.R). The first performs some basic coding tasks and the second illustrates how R scripts can work together. Distributing tasks into modular scripts is good practice for building complex data analysis workflows in R or any other language. 

## Exercise 2: Do mini coding project

All of my progress in learning how to code has been for some project I was trying to complete. For this exercise, choose a mini project that would be fun, useful to you, or both. 

#### I. Decide on a mini project. 
Broad categories include: 1. **making some kind of visual**, 2. **automating a data task**, and 3. **Making a document or widget**. 

Here are some ideas for inspiration: 
- Draw a map of Nigeria.
- Write a set of functions to convert between English and metric units.
- Choose one of the beginner projects from Dataquest: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/r-projects-for-beginners-with-source-code/
 

#### II. Do the project
Use the workflow tools that are instroduced in this course (i.e., R projects, Github). Feel free to make a new folder for your miniproject within the course folder. 

##### Some helpful strategies

1. **Break complex tasks into smaller pieces.** For example, to draw a map of Nigeria, I need to find the map data, download the map data, subset the data I want, draw the plot, and highlight the features I want.

2. **Before coding, try "pre-coding".** Once you break down a task into small pieces, you can use this as the starting point for developing your code. Write each task as a comment in your script and leave some space for the code. An added benefit of pre-coding is that your script is **already well-documented and easy to read!**
