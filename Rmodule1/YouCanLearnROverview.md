# About *You Can Learn R*

This module was developed by Dr. Sam Manski for a 2023 workshop in Ethiopa, moderated by Dr. Frederi Viens. Dr. Manski developed and tested this material as a component of his PhD dissertation at Rice University. 

Rice students and 2023 workshop participants gave glowing reviews about how this module helped make learning R accessible and fun. 

You can find Dr. Manski's original workshop materials on Posit Cloud: https://posit.cloud/content/5486172. This folder contains a PDF copy of his original book chapter and R exercises with minor revisions for an asynchronous format.
